## Problem-Statement
* In the competitive online retail market, customer engagement and satisfaction often fall short due to the lack of personalized, interactive assistance. This clothing website addresses this by implementing a virtual shopping assistant that uses voice input to understand customer preferences, fetch relevant items from the database, and display images of requested clothes. By mimicking a real salesperson, this assistant will enhance the shopping experience, boost customer satisfaction, and drive sales growth, bridging the gap between in-store and online shopping.
